    "Imagine that you have a set of sentences which you want to classify as \"happy\" and \"angry\". And you identified that the sentences contain only two words: *aack* and *beep*. For each of the sentences (data point in the given dataset) you count the number of those two words ($x_1$ and $x_2$) and compare them with each other. If there are more \"beep\" ($x_2 > x_1$), the sentence should be classified as \"angry\", if not ($x_2 <= x_1$), it is a \"happy\" sentence. Which means that there will be some straight line separating those two classes.\n",

You can plot those points in a plane, and see the points (observations) belong to two classes, \"angry\" (red) and \"happy\" (blue), and a straight line can be used as a decision boundary to separate those two classes.

So the problem can be rephrased: in the expression $w_1x_1+w_2x_2+b=0$ find the values for the parameters $w_1$, $w_2$ and the threshold $b$, so that the line can serve as a decision boundary.\n",
