    "With the ability to calculate the t-statistic now you need a way to determine if you should reject (or not) the null hypothesis. Complete the `reject_nh_t_statistic` function below. This function should return whether to reject (or not) the null hypothesis by using the p-value method given the value of the t-statistic, the degrees of freedom and a level of significance. **This should be a two-sided test.**\n",

    "In this case the p-value represents the probability of obtaining a value of the t-statistic as extreme (or more extreme) as the observed value under the null hypothesis. You can use the fact that the `CDF` of a distribution provides the probability of getting a value as extreme or less extreme than the one provided, so the p-value can be computed as `1 - CDF(current_value)`. If you are conducting a two-sided test, you must use the absolute value of the current value since the \"extreme\" condition can be attained by either side. In this case you must also multiply said probability by 2 so you can compare against $\\alpha$ rather than against $\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$.\n",
